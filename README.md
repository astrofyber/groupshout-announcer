# 🎉 Group Shout Announcer
🤖 Discord bot that syncs the group shout messages of a Roblox group with Discord using Roblox API.

# 📚 Packages 
```npm i aoi.js@6.1.1```
```npm I discord.js```

# ⚙️ Configuration
Go to the `index.js` file, and on lines 33-34, change the variables in the code, and you're ready to go.
```	
	groupid: "ID", // PASTE YOUR GROUP ID
	channel: "ID", // PASTE YOUR CHANNEL ID
```
Database folders and npm folders will appear when you run the bot for the first time with the appropriate packages I mentioned earlier.
# ❤️ Credits
Each message is editable through the code, credits are not required but would be appreciated.

# 🛠️ New versions
**I haven't tested the code on newer versions of aoi.js.** \
I typically strive to stay on the latest version of aoi.js, so if v6.1 becomes unsupported, I might consider updating it if necessary.
